#This script checks if an SSH key pair already exists in the id_rsa and id_rsa.pub files under the .ssh directory in the user's home directory. If the key pair does not exist, it uses the gcloud compute ssh-keys create command to generate a new key pair and save it to the specified files.
#To run this script:
#Open PowerShell or a PowerShell Integrated Scripting Environment (ISE).
#Make sure you have the Google Cloud SDK installed and authenticated with gcloud auth login.
#Copy and paste the script into the PowerShell session.
#Run the script.
#After running the script, you will have the SSH key pair (id_rsa and id_rsa.pub) generated in the .ssh directory in your user's home directory. You can then use the private key (id_rsa) for SSH authentication and provide the public key (id_rsa.pub) during the virtual machine creation process on Google Cloud Platform.
#Make sure to replace the placeholders with your actual project ID, instance name, and key name.
#To run the script:
#Save the script to a file (e.g., generate_and_add_ssh_key.sh).
#Make it executable with the command: chmod +x generate_and_add_ssh_key.sh.
#Run the script with the command: ./generate_and_add_ssh_key.sh.
#The script will generate an SSH key pair using ssh-keygen and add the public key to the metadata of the specified instance using the gcloud compute instances add-metadata command. It will display a message confirming that the SSH key pair has been generated and added to the instance metadata.
#Ensure that you have the Google Cloud SDK installed and authenticated with your Google Cloud account before running the script.
